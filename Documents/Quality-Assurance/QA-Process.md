| Objective | Measure                                                                                | Acceptance                                                                                                                                          |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In scope  | Check against the Functional and Technical documents.                                  | All necessary points are achieved.                                                                                                                  |
| On time   | Compare the difference between the planning and the actual progress.                   | Maximum delay for the main tasks up to 25% of the task duration, 50% for smaller tasks. No delay possible for the final product (May 22nd).         |
| On budget | Monetary: report all expenses in a document. Workforce: report absences in a document. | Monetary: No expenses should be made without the aproval of the school's director, Franck JEANNIN. Workforce: Overtime is possible but not imposed. |

<!-- | Conformity to RFC 2119 | Verification of the documents | All documents should comply with it. | -->

| Project Manager | Thomas PLANCHARD              | Scheduling and management of QA tasks. Communications of the rosen issues to the rest of the team.            |
| Developer       | Christopher DIGGINS           | Comply with quality standards. Implement and maintain quality control systems.                                |

# Resources needed for implementation

Automated softwares should be used for the continous quality control. This will be achieved by using Github Actions to automatically check the completeness and correctness of the program on manual request by running multiple test cases.

# Applicable procedures & work instructions

The QA team will have to write test cases to check the confomity of the software.

No conventions are enforced for the documents, code, and documentation, but common sense is required.

To ensure a good working environment, the different team member shall communicate on the Slack channel when they finished a task that requires reviewing from their peers.
