Hello,
As you know, it is crucial that the wine is not exposed to oxygen during the blending process. In order to ensure that the wine remains free from oxidation, it is important to fill each tank completely or leave it completely empty, rather than partially filled.
Could you please provide us with more information on how to deal with partially filled tanks? Specifically, how should we proceed if we have wine left over after filling one tank and need to fill another tank with a smaller amount? Is it possible to transfer the remaining wine to a smaller tank, or should we discard it to avoid exposure to oxygen?

As we begin the blending process for the Krug Champagne project, I wanted to confirm the availability of tanks for the blending process. Could you please let me know if the tanks are currently empty and ready to be filled with the respective wines?
Additionally, I wanted to inquire about the current location of the wines we will be using for the blending process. Could you provide me with an update on where they are stored and the condition they are in? This information will help us ensure that we can maintain the quality of the wine during the blending process.

Could you please provide us with the volume of the tanks that will be used for blending? This information will help us determine the optimal number of steps required to achieve the desired results while minimizing waste.
Additionally, it would be helpful to know the volume of the wines that will be used in the blending process or that we have access. This will allow us to calculate the ratios required to achieve the desired recipe.
We would appreciate any information you can provide on the expected amount of production and the specific recipe that will be used for the blending process. This information will allow us to tailor the software to your specific needs and ensure that we are able to deliver the results you are looking for. (modifi√©)

I wanted to ask a question regarding the champagne blending process. When filling three tanks at the same time, is it considered as one step or three separate steps? I appreciate your help in clarifying this matter.

Your software should be generic and work regardless of how many tanks there are and how big they are. At the start, wine 1 is in tank 1, wine 2 is in tank 2, etc. plus you have a number of empty tanks of various sizes.
You simple cannot leave a tank half empty/full. In other words if you are mixing 3 tanks of 500 hectoliters they have to go into a 1500 hectoliters tanks, there is no other solution.
1,2 -> 3,4,5 (tank 1 plus 2 going to 3,4 and 5) is one step.
Then you could have 3,4 -> 1 (you can reuse empty tanks if they are of the right size).
